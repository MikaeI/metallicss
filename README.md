Using the library is as simple as adding the class `metallicss`, and using CSS properties for configuration (try it out [here](https://www.metallicss.com)).

## Installation:

---

- Download `dist/metallicss.min.js` or install with `npm i metallicss`

- Import with `import metallicss from "metallicss";` or add a script tag before the closing `</body>` of your website: `<script type="module" src="metallicss.min.js"></script>`
